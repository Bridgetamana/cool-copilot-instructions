# cool-copilot-instructions

A personal collection of practical, creative, and useful instructions for GitHub Copilot and other AI assistants.
This repo is for prompts that solve specific, real-world problems and establish creative workflows. This is a place for the prompts you actually use.

## How to Use

The official way to use these instructions in VS Code is:
1. In the root of your project, create a folder called .github.
2. Inside that, create a file named copilot-instructions.md.
3. Browse the instructions/folder in this repo.
4. Find an instruction set you like.
5. Copy the entire content from that file and paste it into your project's `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file.

Now, Copilot will use those rules automatically every time you chat with it inside that project.

*For a quick, one-time use, you can just copy the text from an instruction file and paste it at the start of a new chat*
